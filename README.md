# About
Simple backend service to retrieve and store food recipes to be displayed on frontend
To be used locally for personal development and fun

# TODO
- Unit tests
- Consider images for each recipe to be rendered on frontend
- Support markdown for instructions (or not needed as it's just stored as text)

# Notes
All findings on how I developed this service will be kept here for future reference
